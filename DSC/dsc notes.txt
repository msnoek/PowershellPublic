DSC Notes:

	-use the dsc-metaconfig.ps1 to add servers from a central location (Create specific VM for this?), as it creates a meta config folder with the mof files. Should be able to automate this by changing the $ComputerName variable to pull from a text file created by the VM provisioning process
		*actually, maybe not, test more
	-then run set-dsclocalconfigurationmanager -path "wherever-.mof-was-put"
	-can run update-dscconfiguration -verbose -wait to update local config

	-For the dsc-metaconfig.ps1, make the default configuration one that installs Traps/whatever it's called now
		*Also add logging forwarding to it for Keith
		*Firefox/Chrome/Notepad++ updates as well?
		*add SMB firewall rules?
		*prometheus monitor config
		*backup stuff
